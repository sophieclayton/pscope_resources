# Planktoscope GO-bag
This is a run down of the gear you might want to pack when taking the planktoscope out of the lab and into the field. We can pack most of this gear in a pelican case so we're always ready to go sampling!

## Cleaning:
- Bleach: use dilute bleach (ideally diluted with DI/MQ water) to run through the flow slides after use before storing the planktoscope.
- Vinegar: for cleaning crystallized “junk” out of slide (not necessary if you remember to clean with DI/Bleach before putting away 
- Q-tips: for cleaning the outside of slides.
- Ethanol: use with Qtip to clean outside of slide.
- Compressed air: to remove particles and dust from the slide and lenses.
- Optical paper: to clean the slide and lenses, as needed.
